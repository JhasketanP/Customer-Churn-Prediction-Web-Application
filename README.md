# Customer-Churn-Prediction-Web-Application
This repository contains a fully interactive web-based Customer Churn Prediction system built using React.js (frontend) and Flask (backend). Users can input customer details, and the application predicts whether the customer is likely to churn or stay, along with the churn probability.
